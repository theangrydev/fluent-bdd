## Releases
### 5.0.2
* [#7](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/7) The functionality implemented in [#6](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/6) turned out to be a bit too strict about what it considered to be "mutable". Now the definition of "mutable" is that all the fields must be final. This allows synthetic classes (e.g. a constructor reference) to go through, which turned out to be a common way to write ThenAssertion implementations

### 5.0.1
* Renamed the base class from `FluentTest` to `YatspecFluent`. This is a breaking change
* Support for using `YatspecFluent` as a JUnit `@Rule` alongside a `WithYatspecFluent` interface for the BDD methods if you do not want to extend `YatspecFluent` as the base class for your tests   

### 4.2.0
* [#6](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/6) Check if `ThenAssertion` instances have been reused. Also relaxed all the instance checks to classes that appear to be mutable (have at least one instance field)

### 4.1.1
* Minor changes to the validation messages

### 4.1.0
* [#3](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/3) Check that the same `Given` instance is not used more than once. This is to make it harder to accidentally share state by using the same builder style instance more than once. Similarly for `ThenVerification`.

### 4.0.1
* [#5](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/5) There are now two kinds of `then` methods. `ThenAssertion` is used for chained assertions. `ThenVerification` is used for a blob verification that is built up. See the `ExampleTest` for example usage. This is a breaking change since `Then` was renamed to `ThenAssertion`

### 3.0.1
* Made the `FluentTest` methods public. Protected was enough, but it's clearer that they are part of the public API if they are public
* Fixed some javadoc language issues

### 3.0.0
* Removed `InterestingGivens` and `CapturedInputAndOutputs` fields. The `TestState` can be accessed via the interface `WithTestState` if it is really needed. This is a breaking change since the fields were visible to subclasses of `FluentTest`

### 2.0.1
* [#4](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/4) Remove `Request` from `When`. This is a breaking change
* Mark `Given` as a `@FunctionalInterface` since it has a single abstract method

### 1.6.0
* [#1](https://github.com/theangrydev/fluent-bdd/issues/1) Relax all the wording validation because it was just getting in the way for users rather than providing any value

### 1.5.0
* Adapt when to given
* Relax the constrains on when you must use `and`. Now you are free to use `and` and `given` and `and` and `then` interchangeably, so long as the first `given` is a `given` not an `and` and the first `then` is a `then` not an `and`.

### 1.4.0
* Make it clear that the raw yatspec captured inputs and outputs and interesting givens should not be used

### 1.3.0
* Allow multiple givens of the same type, even if the given is the same instance (this is useful for e.g. priming a rest endpoint for multiple ids)

### 1.2.1
* Allow multiple givens of the same type, but not exactly the same one

### 1.2.0
* Lots of javadoc and renamed `ReadOnlyTestItems` to `WriteOnlyTestItems`

### 1.1.0
* Do not allow given given (should be given and)

### 1.0.7
* Make interesting givens and captured inputs and outputs protected because some yatspec plugins (e.g. sequence diagram generator) need to read them

### 1.0.6
* Updating yatspec to 1.23

### 1.0.0
* An alternative approach to givensbuilders etc in yatspec
